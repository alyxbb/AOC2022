# Advent Of Code 2022

My solutions to the 2022 advent of code;

doing this as an attempt to build familiarity with Java.

(yes its April, I don't care)

see https://adventofcode.com/2022 for the challenges.

this code is very messy and could definitely be optimized.
There are a few bugs, but I don't plan on running this code ever again,
and if you are running a random persons AOC solutions 4 months after AOC there is probably something wrong with you!
